The project is based on visualizing metrics generated by your SpringBoot Server.

### Built With
* [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - rometheus is a free software application used for event monitoring and alerting. It records real-time metrics in a time series database built using a HTTP pull model, with flexible queries and real-time alerting.
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) - Grafana is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources.
